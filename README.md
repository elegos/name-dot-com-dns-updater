# name.com DDNS service

The image checks every 15 minutes for eventual public IPv4 change, and thus updates the name.com's DNS records registry via API (v4).

## How to run the image

The image is based on environment variables, set at run time. The variables are the following:

- NAME_DOT_COM_USERNAME: the username or email used to login into the name.com's backoffice
- NAME_DOT_COM_TOKEN: token generated by the [API Token Management page](https://www.name.com/account/settings/api)
- DOMAIN_NAME: the 2nd level domain level (ex. example.com for www.example.com)
- DOMAIN_NAME_HOST: the sub-domain host to update (ex. www for www.example.com)
- TTL (optional, default 300): the sub-domain's TTL
